        Hello, Myself Arnab Pal, I am a Passionate Frontend Developer, Who is
        currently focused on learning Backend Development. My Passion for Web
        Dev Started in My Early Years of college life When I used to Make Simple
        HTML and transitioning those through beautiful designs. Throughout my
        journey in Tech, I also have the privilege of working with Artificial
        Intelligence and utilized it to enhance performance of various apps.
